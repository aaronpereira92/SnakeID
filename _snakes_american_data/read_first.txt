As the file size is quite big, I couldn't upload to git hub. 

For the training of the CNN I only used images of Class 3 (Class 3: Storeria dekayi - DeKay's Brown snake) 
and Class 5(Class 5: Crotalus atrox - Western Diamondback rattlesnake).

I plan to train the CNN further in the future, to include the other 3 species.
