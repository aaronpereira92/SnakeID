# SnakeID - Ironhack Final Data Analytics Project

##Description
This repository contains two trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) which are able to identify two species of snakes- the Western diamondback rattlesnake and DeKay's brown snake. I plan to include another three species of snake into the classification task at a a latter date.
